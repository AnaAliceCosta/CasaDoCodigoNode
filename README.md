# Examples

Marko provides an elegant and readable syntax for both single-file components
and components broken into separate files. There are plenty of examples to play
with on [Marko's Try-Online](http://markojs.com/try-online/). Additional
[component documentation](http://markojs.com/docs/components/) can be found on
the Marko.js website.

## Single file

The following single-file component renders a button and a counter with the
number of times the button has been clicked. [Try this example now!](http://markojs.com/try-online/?file=%2Fcomponents%2Fcomponents%2Fclick-count%2Findex.marko)
